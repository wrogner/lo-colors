LibreOffice color palette

LibreOffice comes with an unattractive standard color palette that hasn't changed since StarOffice. 
We gave it an overhaul and included MS Office standard colors (Larissa) in the process. 
Documents can now include a uniform color palette and retain color layouts on different platforms.

Store the palette in the folder: ~/.config/libreoffice/4/user/config/standard.soc
Restart LibreOffice

Works with Apache OpenOffice
